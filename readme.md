# The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

This project comprises of downloading data from IMDB (actors, movies, and co-actors) and making an interface for finding the shortest path between Kevin Bacon and another actor whose name is entered by the end-user. Two actors are linked together if they have starred in a movie together. Thus, given an actors name the interface will return a sequence of other actors (related by common movies) that connect up to Kevin Bacon. The length of the shortest such sequence is known an the Bacon Number that the other actor or person possesses.
